# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
In this milestone, I added a code that can help shoot the projectile of the player and opponent. Mainly this
milestone was about implementing pointers and unique pointers into our code. I also added a score and game over screen.
## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
I had a difficult time working with pointers as they are complex and difficult to understand. I still don't really
know how they work, but I eventually figured somewhat how they worked. Also had a bit of trouble figuring
how to shoot the projectiles.
## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing I've learned from this milestone was understanding how to use pointers and 
implement them into our code. Also implementing the mouse into the game.
